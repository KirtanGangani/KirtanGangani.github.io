    <p>
      I am a recent B.Tech graduate in Computer Engineering from Ajeenkya DY Patil University, where I completed my degree with a GPA of <strong>9.41/10</strong>. Currently, I’m a Research Intern at the <a href="https://sustainability-lab.github.io/" target="_blank">Sustainability Lab</a>, IIT Gandhinagar led by <a href="https://nipunbatra.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Nipun Batra</a>, where I’m applying artificial intelligence to healthcare — specifically, building vision-based systems for sleep apnea detection using thermal imagery alone, without relying on wearable sensors.

      My technical strengths lie in machine learning, computer vision, NLP, and large language models. I enjoy designing end-to-end ML pipelines and have worked extensively with frameworks like TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers, and YOLO architectures. I’m deeply motivated by research that blends practical impact with technical rigor, and I aspire to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science to further explore AI for real-world challenges.

      Outside of academics, I am a chess player with a peak Chess.com rapid rating of 1890.
