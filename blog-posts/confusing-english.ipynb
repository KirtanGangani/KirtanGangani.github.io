This blog is to clear confusions for some of the most common word pairs and help you speak and write with greater confidence."

    "This can feel a bit confusing, but once you get it, it's straightforward. It's all about whether the information is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "**That:** Used for restrictive clauses (essential information). The clause beginning with \"that\" provides information that is crucial to the meaning of the sentence. Without it, the sentence's meaning would change significantly. No comma is used before \"that.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Example:** This is the car that I want to buy. (The clause \"that I want to buy\" specifies which car it is.)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Example:** The old car, which has a rusted bumper, still runs perfectly. (The fact that it has a rusted bumper is extra info; the car still runs perfectly whether it has one or not.)\n",

    "Tip: If you can remove the clause without changing the fundamental meaning of the sentence, use \"which\" and surround it with commas. If you can't, use \"that.\""
